In this semester, I am taking a course called Principles of Programming Language. It introduces some interesting programming language concepts such as dynamic scoping, duck typing, functional programming, and logic programming. However, what I enjoy most in the course is that I get a lot of chance to explore and compare drastically different languages. In a 13-week semester, we have to turn in assignments written in COBOL, C, Java, Python, Perl, Prolog, and ML. This is a very exciting experience and reminds me of my very own journey in programming languages. This article is kind of like a chronicle where I record all the programming languages I got exposed to during the first 15 years of my programming "career".

## ActionScript 2 and ActionScript 3
It all began in the third year of my elementary study. At that time, Flash games such as Neopets and Mr. Snoozleberg are all the rage. I remember that I always looked forward to every weekend, when I was allowed to play for an hour of Flash games with my little brother. I was so amazed by the Flash games that I wished I could make one of those someday. As a result, my mother sent me to a Flash game development summer camp held by a university in my city. My journey of programming thus began, like many of the fellow programmers out there, it was all because of the desire of making a game.

<br />

Actionscript 2 and Flash 8 was the newest technology then, and hence they were taught in the summer camp. As a third-to-fourth-year elementary school student, it was quite difficult for me to wrap my head around many concepts of programming languages (Note that at that time programming-for-kids software was non-existent, and the web wasn't filled with programming tutorial resources yet). However, after attending in the summer camp and reading two Flash 8 tutorial books I purchased with my own allowance, I finally got a hint of how functions, variables, objects, as well as all the `MovieClip`s and `gotoAndStop()`s work. The first project I completed is a diving game, where the player controls a diver using the arrow keys, if the diver successfully reaches the bottom of the ocean without hitting any of the sharks, the player wins. Though it was an extremely simple game, the experience was so satisfying that I couldn't wait to dive deeper in the world of programming.

<br />

Micromedia was purchased by Adobe soon after I completed my first project, and they switched from Actionscript 2 to Actionscript 3. The upgrade from Actionscript 2 to 3 made the language more robust and more like a real programming language. By following the update, I got a stronger sense of what data types and object-oriented programming were all about. Therefore, thinking back, I always thought of Actionscript 3 as my enlightener of programming.

## Java, C and C++
Yahoo Knowledge+ was a popular forum like Quora back in my childhood years in Taiwan, people post questions and others answer it to gain virtual points. After the exploration of Flash and Actionscript, I wanted to go further in the world of programming and build a "real game like MapleStory", so I posted my question titled *"What programming language should I learn if I want to make a game like MapleStory?"* on Yahoo Knowledge+ and waited for a response.

<br />

The great internet replied me with Java, C, and C++. Excited, I went to the book store, and found that books with "Java", "C" or "C++" in their titles are all as thick as a dictionary. I started reading them anyway. I remember that I ground through most of the contents of *Thinking in Java*, *C Primer Plus*, and *C++ Primer Plus* even though I couldn't grasp many of their contents. For a middle school student, this was really quite an accomplishment.

<br />

The concepts of pointer, reference, pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, and inheritance finally clicked in my mind after the long grind of flipping through the pages. Though I did not completed any big project aside from a calculator using Java Spring, these few years of reading truly enhanced my knowledge in programming, and later on made my university studies a lot more easier than my fellow classmates. (Few years later during my university years, whenever a classmate was scratching their head over the ideas of pointers/references/polymorphism and inquired about my "secret in how to write code so fast", I always replied that I went through all these during middle school.)

## Visual Basic
Unlike all of the other middle schools in Taiwan, our school offered an elective "hobby" course for grade eight students. I chose "Introduction to Programming" of course. The teacher taught the course using the notorious Visual Basic, the only "for educational purposes" language at that time. With the knowledge of Java, C, and C++, learning Visual Basic was really dull and painful, but what's more painful was to watch over half of the classmates struggling with Visual Basic and hating programming after the course. Really, thinking back, we might have lost many programming talents just because they were introduced to programming using Visual Basic (or C and C++), and was frightened off after their attempt on learning it. (We can clearly see a rise in beginner or hobbyist programmers these years, and I think this is partly because of the switch of beginner programming language from Visual Basic to Python, Javascript, or even Scratch.)

<br />

I completed a small "tool-collection" project (including a toy MS Paint, a guessing game, a calculator, some other random stuff which I can't remember) using Visual Basic after the course and swore that I would never touch that language ever again.

## C and Java again...
Without a doubt, I got into the computer science major. In my university, we were introduced to the C language first, and then for the purpose of teaching OOP, we were introduced to Java. I breezed through both of the courses without learning anything new, but it was still pretty satisfying to complete the problems on our online judge system.

## Ruby and javascript
University side project.

## PHP
Web intern

## C#
Unity games!!! Published many of them.

## Swift
Google Summer of Code internship. An app.

## GDScript
Game published on Steam.

## Dart
A Flutter app.

## Python and Octave
Try to get into machine learning.

## Prolog
AI coursework.

## Tons of Java, C, and Python
Use these language for most of the coursework.

## COBOL, Perl, and ML
Programming language course.

## Go and javascript
Trying do get into web dev again. Planing to do my FYP in Go and javascript. Originally think to try out Typescript, but the learning resources for Typescript isn't that abundant.

## What I Enjoyed Most
Go, Swift, C++
C# and Java are pretty solid
never liked any of the dynamic typed interpreted languages
couldn't wrap my head around non-imperative languages like Prolog

## Conclusion

Just to show off, I've written projects in all the following languages:

* Actionscript
* Java
* C
* C++
* Visual Basic
* (Ruby)     *only some practice code*
* javascript
* PHP
* C#
* Swift
* GDScript
* Dart
* (Octave)   *only some practice code*
* Python
* Prolog
* COBOL
* Perl
* ML
* Go

And the journey continues...
