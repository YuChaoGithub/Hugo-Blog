## Dev Diary
This game is created to attend a developer challenge held by a Taiwanese online forum. Participants of the challenge have to write articles about technology -- which I chose the Unity game engine as my topic -- daily for a 30 days streak. This game was made within the 30 days, and a daily diary had been kept during the project.

<br />

"I WANNA BE AS TALL AS THE SKY...I WANNA BE AS TALL AS THE SKY..." These lyrics are like curses, making Their limbs grow and grow, up through the clouds and into the stars. An unknown journey thus began...
