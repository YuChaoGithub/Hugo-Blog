# Review

In my opinion, this subject along with algorithms are the core of computer science.

<br />

In the first half of the lectures, Prof. Chan went through some basic automaton models and formal languages such as DFA, NFA, Regular Language, CFG, PDA. These materials were quite easy to understand by just going through the lecture notes.

<br />

The most interesting part of the course was the second half of the lectures. We dove into the theory of computation and complexity. The materials included Turing Machines, reductions, decidability, undecidability, NP-completeness, and space complexity. These were the essential knowledge for theoretical computer science so that all computer science students should at least have some basic understandings of them. However, these theoretical topics can get quite confusing sometimes in the sense that even if you study hard, you may not totally grasp the grand idea behind. So, try your best. At least for me, this course taught me about the limitations of not only computing models but also my brain.
