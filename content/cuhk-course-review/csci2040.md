# Review
I already knew Python, but I shamelessly registered this course for that +0.01 GPA boost. To be honest, I only attended one lecture, so I don't know much about this course. I assume it is pretty easy for computer science majors. However, for people without programming language backgrounds, it would be a little challenging because the professor tends to jump between different subjects very quickly.
