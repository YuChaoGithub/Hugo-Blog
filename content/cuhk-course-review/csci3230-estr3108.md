# Review

Prof. Leung is great and very knowledgeable, but the organization of the syllabus is a total mess. They try to fit in too much topics into a single semester, so the professor can only talk about the concepts of the materials rather than diving deep into a topic.

<br />

Also, since the professor only talk about the concepts, students have to self-learn TensorFlow and Prolog to complete the assignments. This is extremely overwhelming for students new to AI.

<br />

In conclusion, I did not learn much in this course and I would definitely NOT recommend this course depsite the popularity of AI nowadays.
