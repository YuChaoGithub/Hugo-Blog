## Description
Boots-Cuts is a beatbox rhythm game I am currently working on. Players could record their voices as drum beats and play music notes by tapping on the screen (or pressing the keyboard for desktop version). Most of the song collections in the game consist of classical musics remixed in a hip hop or V A P O R W A V E style.

## Setting
A young couple and a rabbit accidentally fell in a time machine and traveled back to the 18th century. They tried all the buttons on the control panel of the time machine, and finally figured out that the time machine is music-powered. Help them to fuel up the time machine by playing cool music pieces...
