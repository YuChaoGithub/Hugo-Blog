I'm Yu Chao (趙佑) from Taiwan, a computer science undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I kill time by [reading novels](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18427549.Yu_Chao) and listening to music (mostly British alt rock). I murder time by [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/yuchao.jpg/), writing, and creating [random stuff](/projects).
