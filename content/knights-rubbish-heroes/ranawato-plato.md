# Lore
Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every night…until one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon. It turned out that the spoon was not only handsome, but magical. Ranawato realized that she could actually communicate with the spoon by telepathy and the spoon could do a lot of magical tricks. Together, they roamed the world, performing magic tricks and impressed some depressed souls.

<br />

The founder of [Knights Rubbish](/knights-rubbish-heroes/keshia-erasia), Keshia Erasia happened to be among the audiences in one of Ranawato and the spoon’s magic show. Extremely spellbound by the show, Keshia recruited Ranawato as a member of Knights Rubbish. The spoon wasn’t recruited because Keshia didn’t like spoons, nonetheless, Keshia agreed that Ranawato carry the spoon anywhere she went.
