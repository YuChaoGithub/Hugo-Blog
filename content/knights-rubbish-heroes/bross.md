# Lore
Sirurueruerue Senyesuensuesue & Sugsesugsem Sosas were once the best selling mp3 players. However, smart phones became a thing and they were thrown into the recycle bin by their owner Bobs. They joined the local gang inside the bin and became the SS brothers (even though they had no genetic ties). The gang leader Big Brother had good relationship with the founder of Knights Rubbish, [Keshia Erasia](/knights-rubbish-heroes/keshia-erasia), so he referred the SS brothers to Keshia. After one technical interview, one behavior interview, and one on-site interview, Sirurueruerue and Sugsesugsem finally became members of Knights Rubbish. They discarded their former title “SS brothers” for transitional justice’s sake.
