# Lore
Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, Wendyâ€™s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box.

<br />

One day, [Keshia Erasia](/knights-rubbish-heroes/keshia-erasia), the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly. Nonetheless, Wendy and Keshia still remained good friends, and Wendy became a crucial member in Knights Rubbish.
